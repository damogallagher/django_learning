APIView
Basic view to build api - describe api endpoint
Allows us to define functions to match standard http methods
When to use APIViews -->
need full control over application logic (complex algorithm or updating multiple datasources in 1 call),
processing files and rendering a synchronous response,
you are calling other APIs / services,
accessing local files or data

Creating an APIView
profiles_api --> open views.py

Serializers can take care of validation
